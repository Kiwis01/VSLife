About Bestie
Bestie is a concierge-style, membership-based pet sitting service for busy pet parents in downtown Manhattan. Instead of self-serve booking, our members text us and we coordinate personalized pet care with our vetted network of sitters. We’re now looking to build a smart, backend-powered scheduling tool to help automate the sitter-matching process behind the scenes—without losing the white-glove experience our members love.

What We’re Building
We’re creating an internal booking process where members can enter their requests in free text (e.g., “30-minute walk Friday at 9pm”). The system will:
* Ingest free text from member
* Prompt for any missing info (e.g., location, timing, booking type, etc.)
* Check sitter availability and preferences
* Match the request to the best-fit sitters
* Notify sitters to confirm or decline
* Confirm back to the member once a sitter is booked
This tool will be used internally to streamline operations—not as a public-facing product.

What You’ll Do
* Design and build a backend that can handle:
* Sitter and member profiles, preferences, locations, and availability
* A matching engine to recommend sitters based on past history, proximity, and open schedules
* A messaging flow (via text or interface) to confirm bookings
* Suggest and implement tools (e.g., calendar integrations, SMS APIs like Twilio, etc.)
* Explore and integrate AI tools (e.g., natural language processing, prompt engineering, scheduling intelligence) to improve matching logic and user input interpretation
* Collaborate with the founder (Lauren) to iterate and improve the product based on real usage

You Might Be a Fit If You:
* Are a current college student or recent graduate looking for hands-on experience with a real-world product to add to your resume and portfolio
* Want experience using AI tools and integrations in a practical, applied setting
* Are curious about natural language processing, recommendation systems, and smart automation
* Have experience with scheduling or logistics tools, matching algorithms, or marketplace apps
* Enjoy designing systems that replace spreadsheets, texts, and manual processes
* Are comfortable asking questions, offering suggestions, and working independently

Tech Stack (Flexible):
* Python
* PostgreSQL or MongoDB
* Integrations: Zapier, Twilio, Google Calendar, Auth0/Firebase
* We currently use OpenPhone so any experience using this tool is a plus, and integrations need to be compatible with OpenPhone

Estimated Time Commitment:
8 to 10 hours/week for 6 to 8 weeks, with potential for ongoing iterations or maintenance work after MVP launch.
